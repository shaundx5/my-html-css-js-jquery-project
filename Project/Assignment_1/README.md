# 🗺️ Holiday Planner — Project Summary

## 📖 Project Overview

Develop a responsive **single‑page holiday planner** that guides users through choosing a destination, selecting accommodation and transport, scheduling activities, and reviewing a complete itinerary with costs. The page streamlines the travel‑planning process while maintaining a cohesive design through a consistent accent colour and custom illustrations.

* Emphasise how **HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), JavaScript and jQuery** are used and integrated.
* Ensure the site is mobile‑friendly and visually polished with a unified colour theme.

---

## 📌 Expected Outcomes

* Demonstrated ability to structure a multi‑section planner with **semantic HTML**.
* Practical understanding of applying **CSS and Bootstrap** for responsive layouts and visual appeal.
* Experience in using **JavaScript** for client‑side logic and **jQuery** for dynamic DOM manipulation.
* Skills in creating a clear, user‑friendly travel planning workflow.

## 🛠️ Languages & Implementation

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTML5**              | Provides the foundational structure with clear sections for interests, destination cards, accommodation & transport forms, activity planner, and itinerary summary. Accessible elements and forms are used throughout. |
| **CSS3 + Bootstrap 5** | A custom stylesheet defines a coral accent colour and card styling, while Bootstrap’s grid and utility classes ensure responsive layouts. Buttons, forms and tables use Bootstrap components for consistency.          |
| **JavaScript (ES6)**   | Handles user interactions: capturing selections, calculating costs, generating schedule inputs and assembling the itinerary summary. Arrow functions and template literals keep code concise and readable.             |
| **jQuery**             | Simplifies event handling and DOM updates. It dynamically inserts activity date/time fields, tracks user selections, and populates accommodation and transport options based on the chosen destination.                |
