# 🏛️ Florence City Guide — Project Summary

## 📖 Project Overview

This project presents a richly designed **one‑page guide** celebrating Florence, Italy. It takes visitors on a virtual tour of the Renaissance city’s historic attractions, restaurants, cultural activities and events, complete with interactive maps and a contact form. Smooth scrolling, card flip animations and a warm colour palette evoke the atmosphere of Florence while making the content engaging and easy to navigate.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build an immersive single‑page website showcasing **historic landmarks**, **dining options**, **things to do**, **events** and **contact** information for Florence.
* Demonstrate how **HTML**, **CSS (with Bootstrap)**, **JavaScript** and **jQuery** work together to create responsive layouts, animations, carousels and interactive forms.
* Incorporate additional libraries (AOS for animations, Google Maps API) to enhance the user experience.

---

## 📌 Expected Outcomes

* Mastery of structuring complex one‑page sites with **semantic HTML** and clear sectioning.
* Experience implementing **card flip effects**, **mini image carousels**, **parallax scrolling** and a **preloader** using CSS and JavaScript.
* Understanding of integrating external APIs (Google Maps) and animation libraries (AOS) alongside Bootstrap components.
* Exposure to accessibility best practices such as skip links and keyboard navigation for interactive cards.

## 🎨 Design Guidelines Followed

* **Renaissance-inspired palette:** warm terracotta, golden beige and cream tones define the visual identity.
* **Custom animations:** CSS keyframe animations animate a skyline in the preloader and card flips.
* **High‑quality images:** Photography of Florence’s architecture, gardens and dining experiences adds visual depth.
* **Iconography:** Emoji icons accompany navigation links for immediate context.
* **Accessibility:** Skip link and keyboard‑friendly card navigation ensure the site is usable for all visitors.

## ⚙ Technical Requirements Met

* **Semantic HTML:** Sections are clearly defined for home, attractions, restaurants, things to do, events and contact, improving SEO and screen‑reader support.
* **CSS & Bootstrap 5:** A custom stylesheet sets the colour scheme and animations, while Bootstrap provides the responsive grid, navigation bar and utility classes.
* **JavaScript & jQuery:** Vanilla JavaScript handles preloader removal, smooth scrolling, map initialisation and form validation. jQuery simplifies event listeners for card flips, mini carousels and activity hover effects.
* **External Libraries:** AOS adds scroll‑triggered fade‑up animations, and the Google Maps API displays customised markers for major attractions. Lazy loading improves performance by delaying image loading until they enter the viewport.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTML5**              | Defines the page structure with `<section>` elements for each city guide area. Forms, nav links and headings use semantic tags for clarity and accessibility.       |
| **CSS3 + Bootstrap 5** | A Renaissance‑inspired palette and keyframe animations (preloader skyline, card flips) are defined in `style.css`. Bootstrap’s grid system provides responsiveness. |
| **JavaScript (ES6)**   | Implements logic for the preloader, smooth scrolling, back‑to‑top button, Google Maps setup, notification pop‑ups and carousel behaviour.                           |
| **jQuery**             | Simplifies DOM manipulation for card flipping, activity hover scaling and mini carousel dot navigation.                                                             |
| **AOS & Google Maps**  | Third‑party libraries animate elements on scroll and embed a customised map with stylised markers for Florence’s attractions.                                       |
